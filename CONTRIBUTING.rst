NumPy's Contributing guidelines
===============================

Welcome to the NumPy community! We're excited to have you here.
Whether you're new to open source or a seasoned contributor, your
help is always appreciated.

We understand that everyone has a different level of experience,
also NumPy is a pretty well-established project, so it's hard to
make assumptions about an ideal "first-time-contributor". 
So, that's why we don't mark issues with the "good-first-issue"
label. Instead, you'll find [issues labeled "Sprintable."](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/sprintable).
These issues can either be:

- **Easily fixed** when you have guidance from an experienced
contributor (perfect for working in a sprint).
- **A learning opportunity** for those ready to dive deeper,
even if you're not in a sprint. 

Additionally, depending on your prior experience, some "Sprintable"
issues might be easy, while others could be more challenging for you.

Pull requests (PRs) are always welcome! Your contributions, whether
small or large, are what help this project grow. Please make sure to
follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/),
which applies to all interactions, including issues and PRs.

Thank you for contributing, and happy coding!
